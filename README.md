#Summary and Motivation
This is a biometric Attendance System.I get motivation to build this because lot of time wastage happen due to manual attendance system and lot of
of fake attendance are marked.
In this the student who are going to sit in the class firstly they mark attendance on the gate using face recognition and an otp is generate on the
email they have to correctly type that otp within 5 minutes.
If student are late they automatically get Absent.
This project reduce teacher manual work.And help to deliver and utilize all the time to teach student
